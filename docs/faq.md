## Why?

The idea is to reduce the time that a developer/tester spends on environment provisioning and configuration.

The set of predefined capabilities allows easily manipulating the created environment without additional knowledge of environment structure.

## Running on Windows

Since the connection between client and environment is maintained over standard ssh connection, 
Windows Users are required to additionally install windows ssh client like [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/install.html)   

## Supported Node Versions 

All versions of node.js â‰¥ 4.0 are supported.

## How to deal with the just created environment?

Type `n` on the first question.
Provide correct credentials.
Wait until the environment is finally provisioned.

> ***Note***: <br>
> Be really careful during providing your credentials.  <br>
> According to [current limitation](kial.md) the tool has no chance to recognize credentials correctness/validity during this step.
