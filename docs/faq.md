## Why?

The idea is to reduce the time that a developer/tester spent on environment provisioning and configuration. 

The set of predefined capabilities allows to easily manipulate created environment without additional knowledge of environment structure.

## Running on Windows

Since the connection between client and environment maintained over standard ssh connection Windows Users 
requires additionally install windows ssh client like [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/install.html)   

## Supported Node Versions 

All versions of node.js â‰¥ 4.0 are supported.

## How to deal with the just created environment?

Type `n` on the first question.

Waiting until the environment is finally provisioned.

> ***Note***: <br>
> Be really careful during credential providing. <br>
> According to [current limitation](kial.md) the tool have no chance to recognize credential correctness during this step.
